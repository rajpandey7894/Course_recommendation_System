# 📌 Personalized Course Recommendation Analytics Project

## 📖 Overview  
This project demonstrates analytical thinking, dataset design, pseudocode development, visualization, and insights generation for an online learning platform such as **Udemy or Unacademy**.  
The selected analytical focus is **Personalized Course Recommendation** based on user behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved  

### ✔ 1. Identification of Analytical Features  
Five key analytics areas were defined:

- Course Enrollment Trends  
- Learner Engagement & Progression  
- Instructor Performance Analytics  
- Personalized Course Recommendations  
- Revenue & Pricing Optimization  

---

### ✔ 2. Pseudocode Development  
A structured algorithm was written to show how personalized recommendations can be computed using:

- Average ratings  
- Behavioral similarity  
- Time spent data  

This demonstrates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

---

### ✔ 3. Dataset Creation  
A **synthetic learning interaction dataset** was created containing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| user_id | Unique learner identifier |
| course_id | Unique course identifier |
| rating | Rating given by user |
| time_spent_hours | Hours spent on course |

More than 50+ entries were manually generated for realistic analytics.

---

### ✔ 4. Data Analysis & Insights  
Insights were extracted using **Python analysis scripts** and **Power BI dashboards**, including:

📌 Top-rated courses  
📌 Most popular courses  
📌 Engagement levels via time spent  
📌 Recommendation logic indicators  

Charts created include bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and summary cards.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- Microsoft Word / PPT for documentation  

---

## 📌 Dashboard Highlights  

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

- Bar charts for ranking courses  
- Pie chart for engagement distribution  
- Line chart (optional time trend visualization)  
- Slicer filter by user  
- KPI cards for total ratings & time spent  

✔ Enables interactive exploration  
✔ Supports personalized views  

---

## 🚀 How to Use the Files  

### ▶ Python Script  
- Load `course_learning_dataset.csv`
- Run `analysis.py` to generate charts and output insights

### ▶ Power BI Dashboard  
- Open `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop  
- Use slicer/filter for interactive visuals  

### ▶ Documentation  
- Open `.docx` files for report sections  
- README explains structure and purpose
